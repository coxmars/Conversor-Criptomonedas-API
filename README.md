- Java - version 17 LTS (Long Term Support)
- MySQL Workbench- version 8.0.26
- Other files .jar are essential to run the app, they are included into the code/directories



## Usage
It's simple is just a desktop app with its functionalities


## Project Status
Project is: Completed, the app is finished but some changes can be aplied to improve several functionalities.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- The payment section can be improved in a good way, maybe deleting the crypto payment and just having the credit cards to have better order.
- The database use can be improved a lot, MySQL was used to storage user information, but some tables to order, invoice etc can be created to storage those things.

To do:
- Nothing for the correct functionality of the app, but as I said maybe some changes to improve the UI/UX in payment section etc.
